# GCNAT
A network authentication tool adapted for Ginkgo Campus
The Tianyi Campus Network has already been adapted, meaning the 100.64.x.x range can be used directly. 
For other network segments, you can try them out yourself. Since the program generates config.json and ssid_config.json after running,
it's recommended to place them in a single folder for execution.
Additional features will be added in the future.
