# GCNAT
A network authentication tool adapted for Ginkgo Campus
The Tianyi Campus Network has already been adapted, meaning the 100.64.x.x range can be used directly. 
For other network segments, you can try them out yourself. Since the program generates config.json and ssid_config.json after running,
it's recommended to place them in a single folder for execution.
Additional features will be added in the future.

对于其他网段，您可以自己尝试。
由于程序在运行后会生成config.json和ssid_config.json
建议将它们放在单个文件夹中进行执行。
